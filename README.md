# DrinkSafe App
This an application that my group and I have created for our software development class. 
This app help prevents drunk driving by using a buddy system to help everyone keep track of who's able to drive. 
It takes in the User's height, weight, and gender, and calculates a time when they are able to drive. I had pushed 
this code from our Gitlab repository to my personal Github. I was responsible for the Spring side of our project. I 
had worked on figuring out how to add/manage drinks with our database along with getting our WebSockets to work. On top of 
that, we were learning how to use git with our project. 


# DISCLAIMER 
This app only gives an estimate of when a person is sober enough to drive, it may not be fully accurate for everyone. 

# Technologies
* Android Studio - For our client side development
* Spring Tools Suite 4 - Creating our backend logic
* MySQL Workbench - Database 
* Mockito - For testing frontend and backend
* GitLab - Private repository we used for version control 
* Maven - Build automation tool 


# Project Features
* CI/CD - For uploading our server's .jar file everytime we push our code onto Gitlab
* WebSockets - This is the main component of our application. We used websockets as a chat between users along with how
we are checking who is available to drive and other features.
